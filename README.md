Hello! I'm an ecologist interested in the interaction between wildlife populations, their habitats, and our changing climate. I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Saskatchewan working with Dr. Mitch Weegman and an amazing group of collaborators on the movement ecology of/ conservation planning for Atlantic Brant.
